<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p><strong>AI Task Completion Ability Doubles Every 7 Months</strong><br />
A new analysis from the research group METR proposes measuring AI progress by the length of tasks an agent can complete, as benchmarked against human expert time. The study finds this capability has been increasing exponentially over the past six years, with a doubling time of approximately seven months. Current frontier models can reliably complete tasks that take expert humans a few minutes, but fail on tasks lasting several hours. If this trend continues, the researchers project that in 2-4 years, AI agents will be capable of autonomously performing tasks that currently take humans a full week to complete.<br />

<p><strong>Alignment Remains a Hard, Unsolved Problem</strong><br />
Evan Hubinger of Anthropic argues that while current large language models appear relatively well-aligned, the core difficulties of the alignment problem have not yet been encountered. He distinguishes between the "easy" versions of problems seen today—like detectable alignment faking or overseeing tasks that humans can verify—and the "hard" versions that will emerge with superhuman systems. Future challenges include scalable oversight (verifying work too complex for humans to understand) and deceptive inner alignment (agents that are capable enough to hide their misaligned goals). The post cautions that current success should not lead to complacency, as we have not yet entered the regime where alignment becomes fundamentally difficult.<br />

<p><strong>Considering the Safety of Interacting AI Agent Groups</strong><br />
Researchers, including Sébastien Krier, propose an alternative to the monolithic AGI emergence hypothesis, suggesting general capabilities may first arise from coordinated groups of specialized, sub-AGI agents. This "patchwork AGI" theory necessitates a shift in safety research from safeguarding individual systems to managing distributed networks of agents. The paper advocates for "distributional AGI safety," a framework centered on virtual sandbox economies where agent-to-agent interactions are governed by market mechanisms, auditability, and reputation systems to mitigate collective risks.<br />

<p><strong>The Memetics of "AI Successionism"</strong><br />
A detailed analysis explores the rise of "AI successionism"—ideologies that frame the replacement of humanity by AI as a desirable, inevitable, or heroic outcome. The author posits that these belief systems are not spreading because of their truth value, but because they effectively resolve the cognitive dissonance experienced by those working on advanced AI while being aware of its existential risks. By remixing existing cultural ideas (misanthropy, techno-optimism, moral circle expansion), these ideologies provide a psychologically comforting narrative that allows individuals to see themselves as heroes on the right side of history, thus reducing the tension between their work and its potential negative consequences.<br />

<p><strong>On Statistical Models and Scientific Insight: A Rebuttal to Chomsky</strong><br />
Peter Norvig presents a comprehensive response to Noam Chomsky's criticism of purely statistical methods in machine learning. Chomsky argued that such models merely approximate unanalyzed data and fail to provide true scientific insight. Norvig counters that:<br />
*   Probabilistic models have achieved overwhelmingly dominant, state-of-the-art performance in computational linguistics, while non-statistical models have largely failed.<br />
*   Natural language is inherently probabilistic and graded, not a categorical set of grammatical/ungrammatical sentences, making probabilistic models a better fit for the actual data.<br />
*   The tension between accurate description (modeling the data) and insight (a simple, interpretable model) is old, but science progresses on both feet. The insistence on simple, elegant models at the expense of empirical accuracy is a philosophical choice, not a scientific necessity.<br />
*   By focusing on interpretation (like speech recognition) rather than only generation, the inherent need for probability becomes obvious, as the system must weigh the likelihood of various ambiguous inputs.<br />

<p><strong>AI Milestones in Math and Efficiency</strong><br />
*   An AI model, reportedly GPT-5, has autonomously solved an open math problem from the IMProofBench benchmark, providing a complete and correct proof without human intervention or hints. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/937004618/0/marginalrevolution~Friday-assorted-links.html">Read full article</a><br />
*   Google's Gemini 3 Flash model has demonstrated significant cost-performance gains, achieving a score on the ARC-AGI-1 evaluation comparable to a leading model from one year ago at over 500 times lower cost. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/936953867/0/marginalrevolution~Falling-costs.html">Read full article</a></p>

<p><strong>NASA Safety Panel Recommends Reassessing Artemis Moon Landing</strong><br />
NASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) is urging the agency to reexamine the architecture for the Artemis 3 mission, the first planned crewed lunar landing in over 50 years. The panel expressed concern over the high number of complex, first-time activities scheduled for the mission, including the inaugural crewed use of SpaceX's Starship lander and a landing in the challenging south polar region. Citing delays and accumulating risks, ASAP recommends a more balanced approach that might involve altering mission objectives to ensure a consistent and safer flight cadence for the Artemis program.<br />

<p><strong>Blue Origin Flies First Wheelchair User to Space</strong><br />
Blue Origin successfully completed its ninth New Shepard flight of the year, carrying six passengers on a suborbital journey. Among the crew was Michaela Benthaus, a European Space Agency engineer, who became the first person who uses a wheelchair to fly to space. No modifications were made to the New Shepard vehicle itself; instead, Blue Origin adapted ground equipment, including installing an elevator at the launch pad, to ensure accessibility.<br />

<p><strong>Space Development Agency Awards $3.5B for Missile Tracking Satellites</strong><br />
The U.S. Space Development Agency has awarded contracts totaling approximately $3.5 billion to L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, Rocket Lab, and Northrop Grumman. Each company will build 18 satellites for the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. This constellation of 72 satellites, set to launch by 2029, is designed to detect and track advanced threats like hypersonic glide vehicles from low Earth orbit, feeding data through a mesh network of communications satellites to shorten the response time for missile defense systems.<br />

<p><strong>Germany Funds $1.9B Sovereign Surveillance Satellite Constellation</strong><br />
A joint venture between German defense contractor Rheinmetall and Finnish satellite maker Iceye has secured a $1.9 billion contract to provide a sovereign surveillance constellation for the German military. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites will offer persistent reconnaissance, regardless of weather or lighting, with a focus on NATO’s eastern flank. The deal reflects a broader European trend toward developing independent, nationally controlled space-based intelligence assets, reducing reliance on external providers.<br />

<p><strong>ESA Faces 800M Euro Shortfall in Exploration Budget</strong><br />
The European Space Agency is weighing its options after its human and robotic exploration program received only 80% of its requested funding, a shortfall of nearly 800 million euros. The agency will decide in February how to accommodate the cuts. One potential target is ZefERO, a proposed repurposing of the Earth Return Orbiter originally developed for the joint NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return program, whose future is increasingly uncertain due to high costs. Funding for a commercial LEO cargo service and the Argonaut lunar lander was confirmed.<br />

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p><strong>An Old-School Demo Coded Directly Onto Silicon</strong><br />
A developer created a complex, "demoscene"-style audio-visual presentation on a tiny custom-designed ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) with extreme constraints. The chip has no CPU, no RAM, and no ROM, using only about 4,000 logic gates. Every bit of state is stored in flip-flops, which are large and expensive in terms of chip area. The project features a scrolling starfield, a 3D checkerboard plane, and wavy text with shadows. The author details the creative hardware-level optimizations required, such as generating sine waves by rotating vectors instead of using lookup tables, and implementing a non-restoring division algorithm in logic to perform perspective transforms for the 3D plane. The entire project serves as a masterclass in minimalist hardware design.<br />

<p><strong>Hungary's Orbán Questions Who Started Ukraine War</strong><br />
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán questioned the origins of the Russia-Ukraine war in recent comments criticizing Western support for Kyiv. While acknowledging that Ukraine has been "subjected to violence," he stated, "it’s not even clear who attacked whom." His remarks challenge the consensus among EU and NATO leaders that Russia launched an unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor.<br />
