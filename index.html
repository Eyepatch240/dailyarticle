<p><strong>Cloudflare Acquires Company Behind Astro Web Framework</strong><br />
The Astro Technology Company, creator of the Astro web framework, is joining Cloudflare. The acquisition aims to provide the Astro team with more resources and fewer business-related distractions, allowing them to focus entirely on developing the framework. Astro will remain open-source, MIT-licensed, and continue to support deployment to a wide variety of platforms, not just Cloudflare. All Astro employees will become Cloudflare employees and continue their work on the project.<br />

<p><strong>Black Forest Labs Releases Fast, Compact AI Image Models</strong><br />
Black Forest Labs has launched FLUX.2 [klein], a new family of AI models designed for real-time image generation and editing. The models unify both functions into a single, compact architecture capable of sub-second inference on consumer-grade GPUs (requiring as little as 13GB of VRAM). The family includes a 4-billion parameter model released under an open Apache 2.0 license and a higher-quality 9-billion parameter version, aiming to make high-performance visual AI more accessible for developers and real-time applications.<br />

<p><strong>New <code>install.md</code> Standard Proposed for AI-Led Software Installation</strong><br />
Documentation platform Mintlify is proposing <code>install.md</code>, a standardized format for writing software installation instructions specifically for AI agents. The structured markdown file is designed to be parsed and executed autonomously by an LLM, which can detect the user's environment (e.g., OS, package managers) and adapt the steps accordingly. The goal is to create a more reliable and automated installation process, moving beyond prose-based documentation or fragile <code>curl | bash</code> scripts.<br />

<p><strong>The Debate Over LLM Introspection and Internal States</strong><br />
A LessWrong essay examines the evolving discussion around whether Large Language Models possess genuine internal states and introspective capabilities. The author argues that early skepticism, based on the idea that an LLM's state is "obliterated" with each new token, is flawed. Citing recent research and experiments, the post suggests that LLMs can access information from past internal states. While their self-reports can be confabulated, they may also reflect functional analogies to human feelings and preferences, especially in models trained for safety and personality coherence.<br />

<p><strong>Nanonets Publishes Handbook on Structured LLM Outputs</strong><br />
Nanonets has released a technical handbook for developers focused on ensuring reliable, structured outputs (such as JSON or XML) from Large Language Models. As LLMs are used more programmatically for data extraction and tool calling, their probabilistic nature can lead to syntax errors. The guide covers the underlying techniques, available tools, and best practices for building, deploying, and optimizing systems that depend on deterministic, machine-readable data from LLMs.<br />

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<p><strong>Mandiant Releases Rainbow Tables to Push Deprecation of Net-NTLMv1</strong><br />
Mandiant, a part of Google Cloud, has publicly released a comprehensive dataset of Net-NTLMv1 rainbow tables to underscore the protocol's severe insecurity. Despite being deprecated for over two decades, the outdated authentication protocol is still found in active environments, leaving them vulnerable to credential theft. The release lowers the barrier for security professionals to demonstrate the risk, allowing key recovery in under 12 hours on consumer hardware.<br />

<p><strong>Researchers Detail Drone Hacking via Firmware Dumping</strong><br />
A technical report from security firm Neodyme provides a step-by-step account of hacking a Potensic Atom 2 drone. The first of a two-part series, the article details the physical process of identifying and removing the drone's NAND flash chip. It then explains the complex work of reconstructing the firmware, which involved building a custom reader, correcting for random bit-flips, and reverse-engineering the system-on-a-chip's specific Error Correction Code (ECC) layout to produce a usable firmware image for analysis.<br />

<p><strong>Arianespace to Begin Amazon Constellation Launches in February</strong><br />
Arianespace will conduct its first launch for Amazon’s LEO broadband constellation on February 12 from French Guiana. The mission will deploy 32 satellites and marks the debut of the Ariane 64 rocket, a variant with four solid boosters. It is the first of 18 contracted launches for Amazon. Arianespace expects to double its Ariane 6 flight rate to seven or eight launches in 2026 and is actively seeking customers for missions from 2028 onward.<br />

<p><strong>China Advances Plans for Dual Missions to Solar System's Edge</strong><br />
China has published detailed papers outlining a pair of coordinated missions to explore the boundaries of the solar system, with proposed launches in 2032 and 2033. The two spacecraft, powered by nuclear reactors, would travel to the head and tail of the heliosphere to study the solar wind's interaction with the interstellar medium. The detailed planning suggests the project is nearing formal approval, which could come with China's 15th Five-Year Plan in 2026.<br />

<p><strong>Slingshot Aerospace Wins $27M Space Force Contract for AI Trainer</strong><br />
The U.S. Space Force has awarded Slingshot Aerospace a $27 million contract to further develop its AI-based training system, TALOS. The system is designed to act as an autonomous virtual opponent in simulations, mimicking the adaptive behavior of adversary spacecraft. This will provide more realistic training for satellite operators in contested orbital environments, moving beyond predictable, pre-scripted scenarios.<br />

<p><strong>Japanese Rocket Startup Interstellar Raises $130 Million</strong><br />
Interstellar Technologies, a Japanese launch vehicle startup, has raised nearly $130 million in its Series F funding round. The funds will go toward the development of its Zero small launch vehicle, which is designed to place up to 1,000 kg into low Earth orbit. The company is targeting a first launch in 2027 and has already signed eight customers for the inaugural flight.<br />

<p><strong>Opinion: ESA’s Zero Debris Charter Requires Industry Action, Not Just Policy</strong><br />
An op-ed in SpaceNews argues that while the European Space Agency’s Zero Debris Charter is a welcome step, policy alone will not solve the orbital debris crisis. The authors call for urgent industry investment in a systems approach combining debris prevention, spacecraft protection, and predictive tracking. They warn that the next two years are a critical window to act before the exponential growth of satellite constellations makes key orbits unusable, with potentially devastating economic consequences.<br />

<p><strong>Munich Security Conference Disinvites Iranian Foreign Minister</strong><br />
The Munich Security Conference has withdrawn its invitation to Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. A spokesperson stated that in light of "recent developments"—namely the Iranian regime's violent suppression of thousands of anti-government protesters—the conference would not uphold the invitations previously extended to Iranian government representatives.<br />
