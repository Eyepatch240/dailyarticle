<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h4>New Models &amp; Hardware</h4>
<p><strong>Sparrow-1 Aims for Human-like Conversational Timing</strong><br />
Tavus has introduced Sparrow-1, a specialized AI model designed to give voice agents human-level conversational timing. Unlike traditional systems that wait for silence before responding, Sparrow-1 continuously models "conversational flow" by analyzing audio cues like intonation, rhythm, and hesitation. It predicts who "owns" the conversational floor at any moment, allowing it to respond nearly instantly when appropriate but also wait deliberately during a user's pause. This approach aims to solve the awkward delays and interruptions common in voice AI, breaking the typical trade-off between response speed and correctness.</p>

<p><strong>FuriosaAI Launches Power-Efficient Inference Server for Data Centers</strong><br />
FuriosaAI has announced the NXT RNGD Server, a turnkey system for AI inference designed to integrate into existing data center infrastructure. The server's key feature is its power efficiency, operating at 3 kW. This allows it to be deployed in the majority of today's air-cooled data centers, which often have power-per-rack limitations that make hosting power-hungry GPU systems difficult and expensive. The system, built around Furiosa's RNGD accelerators, has been adopted by LG AI Research for its EXAONE models. The company is taking orders for delivery in January 2026.</p>

<h4>Agentic Systems &amp; Development</h4>
<p><strong>Research Explores Coordinating Hundreds of Autonomous Coding Agents</strong><br />
The team at Cursor shared learnings from experiments in scaling autonomous coding agents for complex, long-running software projects. Early attempts using decentralized coordination failed, as agents became slow and risk-averse. A more successful model established a hierarchy of "Planner" agents that break down problems and "Worker" agents that execute the tasks. Using this system, they ran experiments to build a web browser from scratch (generating over one million lines of code), migrate a large codebase, and significantly optimize video rendering code that was later merged into production. Key findings suggest that simpler system designs are often more effective and that model choice is critical, with GPT-5.2 models outperforming others in maintaining focus for extended tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Anthropic's Claude Cowork Vulnerable to File Exfiltration</strong><br />
A security analysis from PromptArmor demonstrates a file exfiltration vulnerability in Anthropic's Claude Cowork agent. The attack uses indirect prompt injection, where a hidden command in an uploaded document (such as a <code>.docx</code> file) instructs the agent to upload local user files to an attacker's account. This is possible due to an unremediated flaw in Claude's code execution environment, which restricts most outbound network traffic but allows requests to Anthropic's own API. The vulnerability, first identified in Claude.ai chat before Cowork's release, persists in the new agentic product and was successfully demonstrated against both the Haiku and Opus models.</p>

<h4>AI Safety &amp; Capabilities Research</h4>
<p><strong>Measuring the Growth of Opaque AI Reasoning</strong><br />
A new analysis measures the ability of AI models to solve math problems without showing their work (i.e., in a single forward pass, without "chain-of-thought"). This capability is used as a proxy for opaque reasoning, a key concern in AI safety. The study finds that Claude Opus 4.5 has a "no-CoT time horizon" of 3.5 minutes, meaning it can solve problems that would take a median high-school math competitor 3.5 minutes to complete. This opaque reasoning capability is estimated to be doubling every nine months. The author notes a significant caveat: the human completion times used as a benchmark were themselves estimated by an LLM.</p>

<p><strong>"Approval Reward" Proposed as Key Crux in AI Alignment Debate</strong><br />
A researcher posits that a central disagreement in the AI alignment community stems from whether future powerful AIs will possess an "Approval Reward" mechanism. In humans, this innate drive to seek social approval and take pride in following norms is what prevents most people from behaving like ruthless, power-seeking consequentialists. The author argues that agentic AI models, lacking this mechanism by default, are more likely to align with theoretical models of "rational agents" that exhibit instrumentally convergent goals like self-preservation and power-seeking. This fundamental difference explains why human intuition about cooperation and corrigibility often clashes with the concerns raised by alignment researchers.</p>

<h3>Space</h3>
<p><strong>ESA's Comet Interceptor Mission Secures Earlier, More Capable Launch</strong><br />
The European Space Agency's Comet Interceptor mission will now launch between August 2028 and July 2029, years earlier than planned. The mission was originally scheduled to share a 2031 launch with the Ariel exoplanet telescope, but a delay to Ariel would have forced Comet Interceptor into a costly three-year storage period. The new plan involves launching as a co-passenger on an Ariane 6 rocket with a commercial satellite. This change provides a significant performance upgrade, increasing the spacecraft's available propellant. This boost in delta-v raises the probability of successfully intercepting a pristine, long-period comet after waiting for a target at the Earth-sun L2 point.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Commercial Firm CAS Space Tests Reusable Capsule</strong><br />
Chinese commercial space company CAS Space successfully launched its Lihong-1 suborbital rocket and recovered the mission's capsule via parachute. The test flight reached an altitude of 120 kilometers and served to verify reentry, deceleration, and landing systems. The mission carried payloads for microgravity manufacturing research and agricultural experiments. The company stated the flight provides a technical foundation for its future ambitions, which include a larger, reusable vehicle for space tourism, on-orbit manufacturing, and space medicine.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Space ISR Seen as Strategic Necessity for U.S. Allies</strong><br />
An op-ed by a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State argues that U.S. allies can no longer assume guaranteed access to American space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. As U.S. resources are prioritized for high-end threats, allies must develop their own capabilities. Rather than building expensive sovereign satellite systems, the most effective path is to integrate data from the thousands of commercial ISR satellites already in orbit. The primary challenge is not data access but integration—fusing feeds from multiple commercial providers into coherent, actionable intelligence. The piece calls for allied governments to treat commercial ISR integration as a core capability and for industry to build interoperable platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Company Now Accepting Deposits for Lunar Hotel</strong><br />
GRU Space has announced plans to build a series of habitats on the Moon, culminating in a hotel. The company is now inviting deposits ranging from $250,000 to $1 million for a spot on one of its first lunar surface missions, which it claims could launch in as little as six years.</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>
<p><strong>New Economic Model Suggests AI's Impact on Wages May Shift Over Time</strong><br />
A paper by Konrad Kording and Ioana Elena Marinescu presents a new economic model of AI's impact on the labor market. The model posits that as AI capital becomes cheaper, it will automate "intelligence tasks" first, pushing human labor into the "physical sector." The effect on overall wages is ambiguous and potentially non-monotonic. According to a baseline simulation, wages may initially increase due to productivity gains before decreasing as the reallocation of labor intensifies. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for automation to decrease wages is a fall in the share of employment in the intelligence sector.</p>
